// take an array as an argument

// if the array length is 1 return it as sorted

// if the array length is greater than 1 split it into 2 halves with any odd numbers splitting the same way every time

// call the function recursively on those two array halves

// compare the two returned arrays and sort them by comparing the first number in each array;
// the smallest number gets added to a new array. Keep doing this until both old arrays are
// empty. If one array is empty then just push all remaining items from the non-empty array 
// to the end of the new array

// when all the comparing is complete return the new array
